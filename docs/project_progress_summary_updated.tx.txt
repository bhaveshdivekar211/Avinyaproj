Started with 4 scripts: predict.py (dummy unrelated model), train_fusion.py (single EDA LSTM), data_prep.py (only S2 subject), napp.py (fake Streamlit UI).

Identified main flaws: no real fusion, label noise, no preprocessing, toy model, hardcoded paths, no proper evaluation.

Made production-ready: multi-subject (S2–S17) data prep for ECG+EDA, late-fusion LSTM model, proper train/test split, checkpoint resuming, Streamlit inference with file upload.

Automated data_prep for all subjects 2–17.

Added GPU forcing/check code, checkpoint fix for weights format.

Fixed Streamlit issues: wrong run command, shape errors on .npy, empty files, blank screen, static-looking plots.

Evolved napp.py: fake simulation → real .npy playback → scrolling raw plots + processed window inference + stress level progress bar + final stress display after playback + reset on restart.

Removed physics-related discussion.

Future scope:
- True real-time sensor input (serial/Bluetooth from wearable)
- Add HRV feature extraction (RR intervals, LF/HF ratio)
- Subject-independent training (LOSO CV)
- More modalities (EEG if new dataset)
- TFLite/ONNX export for edge devices
- Graded stress (regression instead of binary)
- Artifact filtering + bandpass in prep
- Mobile/web deployment
- User calibration per person
